# Pipeline 38

This is a follow- up to Pipeline 37. The aim is to create a serialisation format of a data pipeline. There is one key change from Pipeline 37: <br />

Data will be manipulated using PostgreSQL commands rather than in a Pandas Dataframe format. <br />

**Technologies used:**
PostgreSQL 17.0, <br />
Python 3.13.0, <br />
Pandas, <br />
SQLAlchemy 2.0.36, <br />
psycopg 2 2.9.10, <br />


pgAdmin 4 <br />
PyCharm <br />

**Objectives:**
 1. Create tools for automated data process including cleaning, transformation, and processing.
 2. The application can generate a working serialisation format of a pipeline.
 3. Improve performance for large datasets with use of PostgreSQL queries.

**Goal:**
Improve my workflow for large datasets to create useful analysis for Tableau.
